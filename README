This is an initial release and still requires documentation. I also want to make it easier for people to override the methods for drawing the control elements so that developers can use it to create rotary controls of there own.

Know Issues
- Currently the minimumDomain and maximumDomain are not respected when the style is NDRotatorStyleLinear and wrapAround is YES.
- No unit tests.
